Day02 - How LEDs AWork (Arduino basics)

Objective : Understand the working principle of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs).

Components Used : 
- Arduino Uno
- Breadboard
- LED (external)
- Resistor (100Ω)
  What I Did:
  Watched a tutorial explaining how LEDs function and tested with Arduino.
  Problem Faced:
  Initially confused about LED polarity and resistor placement.
  Solution:
  Learned to identify anode/ cathode and always use resisitor in series.
  What I learned :
  - LEDs only allow current in one direction
  - Importance of resistors to prevent burnout
  - How to wire LEDs safely with Arduino
